"""GP-50 host->device write TRANSPORT (packet builder) + a hard-gated sender.

  BUF = [crc, cmd, index, length, *payload]     # crc = CRC-8/0x07 over BUF, slot 0

This module builds byte-identical packets (verified below against a real Suite
capture) but DOES NOT send speculative writes: send_stream() refuses unless the
caller passes confirm=True AND every packet was validated against captured bytes.

SAFETY: the pedal wedged once from unvalidated traffic. Never send a guessed
write command. A patch write needs its command byte + slot addressing decoded
from a Suite patch-import capture first (see re/DEVICE_WRITE.md)."""
